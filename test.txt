Test suite for Energy Field software

    The Energy Field software's test suite is designed to test varius functions
of the software. The tests are divided into two groups, Automated tests and
interactive tests. The automated tests are done first and require no user
input to run. The interactive tests are designed so the user can input its
values and/or check the output to make sure they're correct.

    After all tests are finished, a message log is shown showing a summary of
errorr, warnings and notes to show the user of anything important that may had
happened during the tests, such as bad validation.

    Each test is described below, along with the steps the test does to conduct
its tests, and instructions to check them they're correct. An example output is
also shown for each test.

|    This test creates 10,000,000 charges and check them to see if they're    |
|properly balanced and check they're at least 15 degrees away from the poles. |
|Then this test rotates the ring 30 degrees and check the charges coordinates |
|to see if they're rotated properly                                           |

|  * This test requires about 320 MB memory to run                            |
|  * This test may take some time on slower machines                          |

|  |  * Positive sign on maximum values is implicit. They're in the table |   |

|  |    table to aid readers.                                             |   |
|  |  * Entering a max-length string may cause a buffer overflow during   |   |

|  |    may be different from compiler to compiler or system to system.   |   |

|    Yes or no prompts are indirectly tested by this test. Any unexpected     |

|negative answer. Check prompt_yn() in prompt.c for more information about the|

|    This test creates 10 charges and output their coordinates, then rotates  |
|the ring 30 degrees and output the new charges coordinates. It is the job of |
|the user to check those values and optionally visualize them in the user's   |
|choice of software.                                                          |
|                                                                             |
|    This test also check for poles and rotated degrees and output them to the|
|right of the generated tables. It is also the job of the user to check them  |
|to make sure they're correct using the same restriction as the Ring Automated|
|Test 1. The user is required to answer to confirm they're correct            |
|                                                                             |
|    The values can be visualized in any software that support plotting       |
|plotting of points, such as Microsoft Office Excel or OpenOffice.org Calc.   |
|Please note that the software you choose to plot the points at should be able|
|to at least support plotting XY values (2D). Critical for 1st table are the  |
|X and Y values, and for the 2nd table are X and Z values.                    |
